      q: 'How are your tutors selected?',
      a: 'Every tutor holds a degree in the subject they teach and clears a subject test, a mock lesson and an enhanced DBS check before working with a single student. We also approve tutors by exam board, because an AQA GCSE Maths paper and an Edexcel one reward different things, and a tutor who knows the mark scheme is worth considerably more than one who simply knows the maths.'
    },
    {
      q: 'Is the free trial really free?',
      a: 'Yes. The first 30-minute session costs nothing, requires no card details and carries no obligation. We use it to establish where your child sits against their year group and what they\'re working towards. If you decide not to continue, that\'s the end of it.'
    },
    {
      q: 'Do you cover Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, or just England?',
      a: 'All four nations, and they are genuinely different systems rather than variations on one. England and Northern Ireland sit GCSEs and A-Levels, though England grades 9 to 1 while Northern Ireland uses CCEA grading. Scotland follows Curriculum for Excellence with National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher, now awarded by Qualifications Scotland, which replaced the SQA on 1 February 2026. Wales is partway through its own reform, with Made-for-Wales GCSEs taught from September 2025 and first awarded in 2027. We match tutors to the nation and the awarding body, not just the subject.'
    },
    {
      q: 'What does a grade 4 actually mean, and is it a pass?',
      a: 'In England, GCSEs are graded 9 to 1 rather than A* to G. A grade 4 is a standard pass and a grade 5 is a strong pass, which is why some sixth forms and employers ask for a 5 even though 4 is technically a pass. The distinction matters most in maths and English, because students who do not reach a grade 4 in those subjects are normally required to keep studying them post-16. If your child is sitting somewhere around a 3 or 4, that boundary is usually the single most valuable place to focus tutoring.'
    },
    {
      q: 'Should my child be entered for Foundation or Higher tier maths?',
      a: 'Foundation tier caps the available grade at 5, while Higher tier runs from 9 down to 4 with a narrow allowance below. The instinct is to push for Higher, but a student who is comfortably achieving marks at the top of Foundation will often secure a stronger grade than one struggling at the bottom of Higher, where the paper assumes content they have not yet secured. It is a strategic decision that should be made on recent mock performance and the grade actually required for their next step, and it is worth revisiting after each set of mocks rather than settled once in Year 10.'
    },
    {
      q: 'When should we start tutoring before GCSEs or A-Levels?',
      a: 'Earlier than most families do. The common pattern is to book tutoring after a disappointing set of mocks in Year 11, which leaves a term to repair gaps that opened in Year 9. Starting in Year 10, or even late Year 9, means the work can be genuinely remedial rather than triage. That said, focused work in the final two terms still helps considerably, particularly on exam technique and mark scheme strategy, which are quick to improve compared with rebuilding subject knowledge.'
    },
    {
      q: 'How much does online tutoring cost in the UK?',
      a: 'Rates are billed in pounds and depend on subject and level, with A-Level priced above GCSE and Key Stage 3 support. There\'s no registration fee and no minimum contract, and lesson bundles lower the hourly rate. Full pricing is on our pricing page.'

            <p className="text-body-lg text-on-surface-variant">
              A great deal of private tuition is just supervised homework, and an hour of that changes very little.
              The difference between a tutor who lifts a grade and one who fills an hour is whether they teach the underlying idea
              or simply work through the questions your child was already going to attempt.
              We hire for the first, then match on temperament, because the tutor who suits a student pushing for a grade 9
              is rarely the one who suits a student who has quietly given up in maths.
